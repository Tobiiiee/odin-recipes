    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For these zesty Mississippi chicken skewers, boneless thigh pieces marinate briefly in ranch seasoning and pepperoncini brine, then are threaded on skewers with pepperoncini and red onion chunks.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet ranch seasoning mix, divided</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package au jus seasoning mix, divided</li>
        <li>2 pounds skinless boneless chicken thighs, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>15 pepperoncini peppers, divided</li>
        <li>1 red onion, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pepperoncini brine, divided</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons cold butter, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove 1 tablespoon of ranch and au jus seasoning mix from each package and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add chicken to a bowl; add remaining ranch seasoning, remaining au jus seasoning, olive oil, and 2 tablespoons pepperoncini brine to the bowl. Toss well and let stand for 20 to 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Divide and thread chicken, 12 pepperoncini peppers, and onion evenly among skewers. </li>
        <li>Heat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat, about 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly coat grill grates and place skewers on hot grill or grill pan. Cook until browned and easily released from grill, about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake skewers in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted in the center of chicken pieces should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Serve skewers with butter sauce.</li>
